- 👀 We are interested in developing a community of content creators to decentralize the content production process.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about further expanding our code and how to best implement strategies that work for creators and audiences worldwide.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the making of our film as we define the specs for our platform.
